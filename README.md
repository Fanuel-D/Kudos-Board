### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

A lot of the topics that were in the labs and assignment did come up but there was also a lot we had to learn on our own.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

I would've worked on sign up and log in page.
  
* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Deployment was acting a bit unusal, making changes after deployment was hard. The models weren't migrating correctly and that led to other issues arising from it. I noticed that one of my peers (Daniel) used user ids for the recent filter, which was pretty clever and required less work than assigning time stamps to users and making that part of models.
